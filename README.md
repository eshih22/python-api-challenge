# WeatherPy and VacationPy Project

## Project Overview

This project is divided into two deliverables: WeatherPy and VacationPy. Both parts involve Python scripting, visualization, and leveraging external APIs to analyze and present weather-related data.

### Part 1: WeatherPy

**Objective:** Visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator using citipy, OpenWeatherMap API, and Python coding skills.


#### Plots Generated:

- Northern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Temperature vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Humidity vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Cloudiness vs. Latitude
- Northern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude
- Southern Hemisphere: Wind Speed vs. Latitude


### Part 2: VacationPy

**Objective:** Plan future vacations using weather data, Jupyter notebooks, geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API.

#### Maps Generated:

- Humidity Map
- Hotel Map

#### Explanation:

Describe the rationale behind filtering for ideal weather conditions and the significance of the chosen criteria.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open each Jupyter Notebook (`WeatherPy.ipynb` and `VacationPy.ipynb`) and run the cells in sequence.

Feel free to explore, analyze, and visualize the provided data. If you have any questions or need further information, please feel free to reach out.

Thank you for considering this project!
